Integrates OpenTelemetry for performance measurement.\n\n### 11. **src/payment**\n\n- Handles payment transactions.\n- **`charge.js`**, **`opentelemetry.js`**: Executes payment logic and integrates OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics.\n- **`index.js`**: gRPC server setup.\n\n### 12. **src/product-catalog**\n\n- Manages product data.\n- **`main.go`**: gRPC setup for service operations.\n- **`genproto/`**: Protocol buffer definitions for communication.\n\n### 13. **src/prometheus**\n\n- **prometheus-config.yaml**: Configuration for data scraping intervals, crucial for system observability.\n- Implements monitoring and alerting via Prometheus.\n\n### 14. **src/react-native-app**\n\n- Mobile front-end using React Native.\n- **`components/`**: Mobile UI components.\n- **`gateways/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`**: Handles API communications, theme management, and OpenTelemetry.\n\n### 15. **src/recommendation**\n\n- Provides product recommendations.\n- **`recommendation_server.py`**: Serves recommendations using gRPC, with OpenTelemetry integration for observability.\n\n### 16. **src/shipping**\n\n- Handles shipping operations.\n- **`shipping_service.rs`**: Core logic for shipping quotes and tracking.\n- **`telemetry/`**: Setups for OpenTelemetry tracing and logging.\n\n## System Interactions\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop functions as a network of microservices, with each service communicating primarily through gRPC. OpenTelemetry is woven into the architecture to provide visibility into each operation through tracing, logging, and metrics. Components like Envoy proxy redouble this interconnected system by managing incoming and outgoing requests, with telemetry data funneled to monitoring interfaces like Grafana through Prometheus.\n\nThe comprehensive monitoring setup ensures any bottleneck or failure in the distributed system is quickly identified and addressed, maximizing reliability and performance. Each service independently contributes to the system's overall capability while maintaining cross-service observability. This makes the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop an exemplary model for monitoring in microservice architectures.
